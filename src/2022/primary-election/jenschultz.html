I support the I-35 rebuild in Duluth to reduce its size by half, giving more lake access and new housing potential with state and federal funding. The Department of Agriculture&#39;s no-money-down mortgages should be promoted for small towns, cities, and rural areas. HUD, the state, and nonprofits should be worked with for affordable housing.</p>

                                    The rising cost of health care is one of the most important and urgent issues facing Minnesotans. Like many in our district, I am in favor of a single-payer system – what some call Medicare for All – that would dramatically cut down on costs associated with health insurance premiums and guarantee coverage for all Americans, regardless of income level.
                                    We are proud that Minnesota offers the lowest premiums in the country on MNsure, our state health insurance exchange. Another great program is MinnesotaCare, which provides health care coverage for people with low incomes. MinnesotaCare was created with bipartisan support and has been successful for more than 30 years. This is a public option that could be expanded to more Minnesotans and used as a template to move us forward at the federal level so everyone can access affordable, quality healthcare.
                                    It is easy to get lost in the details and in politics, but I never lose sight of the fact that, in the end, this is about real people facing some of the hardest and most terrifying experiences of their lives. Families should not have to worry that health care costs will ruin their finances in the wealthiest country in the world. Quality health care should be a right for all Americans.

                                    I support a living wage. This means increasing the minimum wage and indexing it to inflation. We shouldn’t need an act of Congress to pay people more every time life gets more expensive. As an economist, I know that increasing the minimum wage helps the economy by pumping money into the marketplace, creating new revenue for businesses, and creating new jobs.
                                    I support paid sick and safe time, paid family leave, an increase of the working family tax credit, and extending the child tax credit that Congress recently allowed to expire because when working families do well, our economy and our communities do well.

                                    We must address student debt. The average student accumulates $30,000 of debt after four years of college, and the average starting salary with a four-year degree is $50,000. Fifty years ago, those figures would be $7,000 of debt and a $66,000 salary, adjusted for inflation.
                                    Minnesota is home to some of the best public colleges and universities in the country. Lack of wealth should not deter someone who wants to pursue higher education. We must make sure that public post-secondary education is affordable and accessible, whether that’s technical school, obtaining an associate’s degree, or earning a bachelor's degrees. People should not be saddled with a lifetime of crushing debt for pursuing a higher education.

                                    Global climate change is affecting every part of the world, including Minnesota. In the last several years, Northern Minnesota has dealt with significant drought, massive forest fires and damaging floods. The science is clear: these issues will get worse unless we take urgent action.
                                    I see an amazing opportunity for Northern Minnesota to be at the forefront of addressing climate change. We can be a global leader in environmental technology. There’s no reason for the US to continue to subsidize oil and gas companies to the tune of over $20 billion annually, especially when they’ve raised the price at the pump dramatically while enjoying record profits. Instead, we could direct that money toward building dependable green infrastructure that reduces our reliance on volatile, autocratic regimes.
                                    Northern Minnesota is uniquely positioned to take advantage of a shift to green energy. Our highly skilled and experienced workforce would welcome an influx of stable, union jobs created through building and maintaining sustainable alternative energy infrastructure.

                                    Quality infrastructure is essential to our quality of life. It’s the roads and bridges we drive on, power lines that deliver electricity, and pipes that bring us clean water. Taking care of these essential elements of daily life is one of the most fundamental functions of government. 
                                    The recent federal infrastructure bill is a great start, but we can do more. We must provide funding to address the basics of our traditional infrastructure like roads, bridges, water treatment and the electrical grid, as well as new infrastructure like broadband internet access.

                                    The Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v Wade was wrong and will harm millions of people. It’s a fundamental right for every person to make their own health decisions with their doctor, not politicians. We must mobilize, organize, and elect representatives who will fight for our right to choose and codify these long-held protections into law.Reproductive health and freedom is about more than access to safe and legal abortion.  We need to ensure folks have hassle-free access to contraception and quality sex education. Our LGBTQ+ community, and especially the transgender community, must have access to healthcare that covers gender-affirming care.In Congress, I will fight to prevent us from going back to a time when access to quality reproductive care was only available to the wealthy.

                                    Our veterans deserve our utmost respect and admiration.They put their personal safety—and future—at risk to protect ours. They stand up for us with courage and patriotism. We must stand up for them.The Veterans Administration has been hollowed out, understaffed, and under-resourced. That must be reversed. The backlogs and long delays for medical and other services must be eliminated, and that means repairing and modernizing our veterans services. Higher and technical education opportunities must be assured and counseling services be made readily available, linking veterans to these opportunities and preparing them for good jobs in the civilian world. Access to adequate housing needs to be supported. Special attention needs to be paid to services dealing with PTSD, depression, and traumatic brain injuries.Veterans Courts at the local level should be encouraged so that there are legal, chemical dependency, probation, and other services working as a team to help struggling veterans caught up in the justice system. We must make sure that the spouses and children of our active veterans have good housing, support services, and income, and that widows or widowers and children of heroes who lose their lives in the nation’s service are well provided for. Disabled vets and their families must receive the best possible care and support.
