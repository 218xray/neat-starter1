                <div class="flex flex-col text-lg font-medium">
                    <p>I retired from Delta Airlines in Chisholm after 17 years with a union pension, and I live now on our hobby farm with my family in Warba, Minnesota.</p><p>The major issue in my bid for Congress should be affordable housing and property valuations. I support the I-35 rebuild in Duluth to reduce its size by half, giving more lake access and new housing potential with state and federal funding. The Department of Agriculture&#39;s no-money-down mortgages should be promoted for small towns, cities, and rural areas. HUD, the state, and nonprofits should be worked with for affordable housing.</p>
                    <p>I am running for Congress because anyone picked out of the phone book at random could be doing a better job than Rep. Pete Stauber the past four years, with his votes against the economic interests of the 8th District in opposing the American Rescue Plan and infrastructure funding for schools, small businesses, child tax credits, 29 area airports, six iron mines, Duluth&#39;s Can-of Worms project, the cleanup of the St Louis River, and a critically important new lock in the Soo Locks that prevents an economic catastrophe to our grain and ore shipping if the large lock goes down.</p><p>Stauber has promoted low-cost drugs, a cap on insulin, broadband, infrastructure, and support for veterans — and then voted against them like a Libertarian who hates all government. He also voted against reasonable gun regulation, flying in sorely needed baby formula, and prohibitions against oil-price gouging.</p><p>Stauber&#39;s issues of inflation, Trump&#39;s wall, guns, and copper-nickel mining are wrongheaded.</p>
                    <p>He voted against the Consumer Price Gouging Prevention Act in May, which was against oil-price gouging.</p><p>Josh Bivens of the Economic Policy Institute found that one-half of the price increases during the pandemic were due to higher profit margins for corporations. This correlates with other findings that oil companies made $75 billion in profits last year and corporate profits are at 70-year highs. Stauber should have held hearings via his Problem Solvers committee to address excess profits and supply issues, and not just blame others in office for political gain.</p><p>Trump&#39;s wall has been breached 3,000 times, the Washington Post reported, and it cost $21 million per mile to build, according to Reuters. Biden&#39;s wall is electronic, cheaper, and catching more people.</p><p>I favor Virginia Democratic Rep. Don Beyer&#39;s bill placing a 1,000% tax on AR-15-style weapons, as well as age limits and a buy-back program for assault weapons.</p><p>Trading 20 years of copper-nickel mining jobs for 500-plus years of pollution is crazy. Billions of tons of copper, nickel, cobalt, and manganese are obtainable on the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, lying as potato-sized nodules retrievable with crab-like robots, stingray-like robots, or crawler machines.</p><p>Nationally, the Republican platform advocates raising taxes on 60% of taxpayers and sunsetting Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid in five years. This would crazy. See Florida Republican Sen. Rick Scott&#39;s 11-point plan, points five and six.</p><p>In addition, Stauber signed the Amicus Brief to the Texas lawsuit intended to delete the votes of four states and let Republican state legislatures choose Republican electors. This was an existential threat to overturning the popular vote, with Republicans attempting to use the “independent state legislature” theory to choose a Republican president in defiance of the actual vote.</p><p>I also oppose state Rep. Jen Schultz, a fellow Democratic candidate in this election for the 8th District, for apparently thinking copper-nickel mining can be done ecologically. I don&#39;t believe it can be.</p>
                    <p>Abortion should be legal by pills only.</p><p>COVID-19 vaccines have saved lives and serious illness but should not be mandated or prescribed for children who aren&#39;t at risk of death.</p><p>On the trans issue, chemical and surgical interventions should be illegal for minors.</p><p>On a national level, President Joe Biden should invoke the Defense Production Act, making heat pumps and reducing fossil fuels; should push the USDA to provide an asparagopsis seaweed supplement to cattle, reducing the methane they produce; should cap the methane super-emitter wells in the Permian Basin; and should tariff or ban Brazilian imports.</p><p>With the looming food and fuel crises, we should reroute the booming LNG (liquified natural gas) exports to Asia back to the U.S. and Europe. Growing corn for ethanol is not ecological. Corn or grain should be grown on those acres for food.</p><p><b>John Munter of Warba, Minnesota, is running as a Democrat to represent Minnesota&#39;s 8th Congressional District.</b></p>

                                    The rising cost of health care is one of the most important and urgent issues facing Minnesotans. Like many in our district, I am in favor of a single-payer system – what some call Medicare for All – that would dramatically cut down on costs associated with health insurance premiums and guarantee coverage for all Americans, regardless of income level.
                                    We are proud that Minnesota offers the lowest premiums in the country on MNsure, our state health insurance exchange. Another great program is MinnesotaCare, which provides health care coverage for people with low incomes. MinnesotaCare was created with bipartisan support and has been successful for more than 30 years. This is a public option that could be expanded to more Minnesotans and used as a template to move us forward at the federal level so everyone can access affordable, quality healthcare.
                                    It is easy to get lost in the details and in politics, but I never lose sight of the fact that, in the end, this is about real people facing some of the hardest and most terrifying experiences of their lives. Families should not have to worry that health care costs will ruin their finances in the wealthiest country in the world. Quality health care should be a right for all Americans.

                                    I support a living wage. This means increasing the minimum wage and indexing it to inflation. We shouldn’t need an act of Congress to pay people more every time life gets more expensive. As an economist, I know that increasing the minimum wage helps the economy by pumping money into the marketplace, creating new revenue for businesses, and creating new jobs.
                                    I support paid sick and safe time, paid family leave, an increase of the working family tax credit, and extending the child tax credit that Congress recently allowed to expire because when working families do well, our economy and our communities do well.

                                    We must address student debt. The average student accumulates $30,000 of debt after four years of college, and the average starting salary with a four-year degree is $50,000. Fifty years ago, those figures would be $7,000 of debt and a $66,000 salary, adjusted for inflation.
                                    Minnesota is home to some of the best public colleges and universities in the country. Lack of wealth should not deter someone who wants to pursue higher education. We must make sure that public post-secondary education is affordable and accessible, whether that’s technical school, obtaining an associate’s degree, or earning a bachelor's degrees. People should not be saddled with a lifetime of crushing debt for pursuing a higher education.
